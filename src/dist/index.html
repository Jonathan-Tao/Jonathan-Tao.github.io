        <p><b>Custom CoreXY 3D Printer</b></p>
        <p>I designed and built a high-performance CoreXY 3D printer from scratch, taking inspiration from open-source projects like Voron and HevORT. It has a rigid frame composed of 3D-printed parts, all designed in Autodesk Inventor.</p>

        <br>
        <p>The printer uses klipper firmware and input shaping to reach printing speeds up to 1000 mm/s with 4000 mm/s^2 accelerations. The Video shown above is the printer printing a benchi.</p>

        <p><b>W.A.N.D.E.R. Autonomous Robot</b></p>
        <p>I engineered a maze-solving autonomous robot named W.A.N.D.E.R. It features a custom 3D-printed chassis and uses a gyroscope, wheel encoders, and distance sensors to navigate and map its environment.</p>
        <br>
        <video id="wander-video" controls loop muted volume="0.2" src="/assets/robot.71a0f850.mp4" width="640" height="360"></video>
        <br>
        <p>The video above shows the robot following a preprogrammed path through boxes. When in maze solving mode, 2 by 4s are placed on the tape lines and ultrasonic distance sensors are used to see if a plank is ahead of the robot. This is combined with the wheel encoders and gyroscope to get a good idea of the robot's current position.</p>

        <h2>Experience</h2>
        <p><b>Illini Electric Motorsports</b></p>
        <p>As an Embedded Engineer with Illini Electric Motorsports, I'm architecting the transition of our Battery Management System (BMS) firmware to FreeRTOS, boosting real-time performance and scalability.</p>
        <p><b>AbbVie</b></p>
        <p>During my internship at AbbVie, I engineered and deployed an internal RAG support agent using LangChain, OpenAI API, and Power Automate. This reduced information retrieval time for SOPs and equipment guides by over 50%.</p>
        <p><b>AbbVie</b></p>
        <p>In a previous role at AbbVie, I spearheaded the deployment of a wireless camera system in a primate enclosure. This enabled 24/7 autonomous data collection for preclinical research, a huge improvement over manual observation.</p>
        <p><b>Freelance Computer Builder</b></p>
        <p>As a freelance computer builder, I've engineered, sourced, and assembled over $11,000 worth of custom PCs, specializing in small form factor (SFF) and high-performance builds.</p>
        <p><b>Daniel Wright Jr. High School</b></p>
        <p>I've also enjoyed volunteering as a C++ and Python teacher at Daniel Wright Jr. High School, where I instructed over 100 students in core computer science concepts, including C++ and Python fundamentals, data structures, and algorithms.</p>
